    "# Comparative techno-economic analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Techno-economic analyses (TEAs) of emerging and conceptual technologies rarely provide a good estimate of economic viability. In fact, economic indicators are largely overly optimistic due to biased assumptions and unforeseen expenses. The real power of early-stage TEA is the ability to **compare** technologies under harmonized assumptions and establish key **performance targets** that technologies need to meet for market competitiveness. Performing comparative techno-economic analysis under harmonized assumptions, however, can be challenging due to the complexity of managing many biorefinery codes/files. In this chapter, we demonstrate how BioSTEAM can facilitate the evaluation and comparison of many configuration **scenarios** through ProcessModel objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process models\n",
    "\n",
    "ProcessModel objects allow us to write code for many related configurations with ease. It streamlines the process of creating a model, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defining **scenarios** to compare.\n",
    "* Creating the **thermodynamic property package**.\n",
    "* Forming the **system** from unit operations.\n",
    "* Setting up the evaluation **model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, all objects created within the process model (e.g., chemicals, streams, units, systems) can be easily accessed as attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to inherit from the ProcessModel abstract class. An abstract class has missing (or \"abstract\") attributes/methods which the user must define to complete the class. The user must define a `Scenario` dataclass, and `as_scenario`, `create_thermo`, `create_system`, `create_model` methods for the process model to initialize its key components. \n",
    "\n",
    "It may help to look at how ProcessModel objects are created (approximately):\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __new__(cls, simulate=None, scenario=None, **kwargs):\n",
    "    if scenario is None:\n",

    "    system = self.create_system()\n",
    "    if system is None: system = self.flowsheet.create_system()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # This saves the system as self.system and all units/streams as attributes by ID.\n",
    "    # For example, Stream('feedstock') will be stored as self.feestock.\n",
