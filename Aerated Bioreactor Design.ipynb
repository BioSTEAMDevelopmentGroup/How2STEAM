    "The oleochemical industry is focusing renewable feedstocks and more sustainable pathways of production. Microbial pathways are generally not market competitive for the production of commodity oleochemicals, but technological breakthroughs in metabolic engineering are making microbial pathways a promising platform. In this case study, we discuss how to model an aerobic fermentation system for producing microbial oil, which can be further upgraded to sustainable aviation fuel or other oleochemicals. The aerobic fermentation system (including the compressor, reactor, agitator, and heat exchange equipment) constitutes the major cost driver in the minimum oil selling price."

    "In this case study, we implement an industry-relevant configuration consisting of a stirred tank reactor, a heat exchanger loop, and a compressor (Figure 1). If you feedstock is in the form of diluted sugars (e.g., lignocellusic hydrolysate), you may need to concentrated your feed to achieve the a specified titer. This can be done efficiently through multi-effect evaporation, whereby the steam from the first effect is used to boil the next effect using a vacuum system. Alternatively, if you wish to operate at lower titers, you can dilute the sugars. Here we include both possibilities to be able to evaluate a spectrum of titers. Due to the high risk of bacterial contamination, we choose to operate in batch mode. Fed-batch configurations are also possible and can be modeled in a similar fashion. "
